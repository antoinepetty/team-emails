# Emails

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/srobo/team-emails.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/srobo/team-emails)

A history of communication with teams. Organised by event and date sent. If it's in `master`, it's been sent!

If an email contains links to forms, or other potentially sensetive information, leave the link out of the emails!

## How to send emails

### Mailchimp

Emails should be sent using the MailChimp account.

When sending emails to 'All Teams', please send to both the _"Website - Potential Team Leaders"_ and _"Potential Team Leaders"_ lists.

### As an alias in Gmail

#### Setup

In Gmail, go to settings->accounts and add teams@studentrobotics.org under the 'Send mail as' section.
You will need to verify this by clicking a link automatically sent to teams@studentrobotics.org.

#### Sending

Select the 'Recipients' field when composing a new email. You will see an option to switch the 'From' field to the teams@ address.
