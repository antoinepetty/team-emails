Hello there!

We're pleased to announce sign-ups are now open for Student Robotics 2022!

## Competition

This year is the long-awaited return of the physical robotics competition! We're really excited to be going back to what we do best: An intense, exciting, and adrenaline-fuelled competition.

In order to allow the core team of volunteers to focus on delivering a high quality programme while requiring far fewer resources than before, this year's competition will be slightly smaller than previous years. We expect to be able to increase the size of the competition again in the future.

## Kickstart

Kickstart will be streamed live on **13th November 2021**. Here we'll announce the game for this year, go into further details on how the competition year will work, and of course answer any questions you have.

If you already have a kit from a previous Student Robotics competition, please keep hold of it. If not, we will contact you soon to coordinate shipping a kit out to you.

Visit [our website](TODO) for more information.

## Sign up

If you would like to compete in Student Robotics 2019, please fill in the form at the link below with the required information. All further emails about SR2019 will be sent there. The closing date will be *6th October*.

[I'd like to bring a team to Student Robotics 2022]

As always, if you have any questions please let us know!
